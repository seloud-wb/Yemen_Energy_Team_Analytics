# Yemen Energy Analytics Portal

Streamlit prototype for the Yemen Energy Team. This repo currently contains a minimal scaffold so we can iterate on individual pages without extra styling.

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Structure

- `app.py` – main entry point.
- `pages/` – additional Streamlit multipage views.
- `src/` – shared helper code (empty for now, ready for future logic).

Feel free to expand each section as we refine requirements.
